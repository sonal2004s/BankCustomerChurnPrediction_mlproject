# BankCustomerChurnPrediction_mlproject
TOPIC-Bank Customer Churn Prediction

OVERVIEW-Our project aims to predict customer churn probability using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various factors such as customer demographics, transaction history, and behavior patterns, we can anticipate which customers are likely to leave. This proactive approach enables businesses to implement retention strategies and minimize customer attrition.

OBJECTIVE-The objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast customer churn, allowing the bank to proactively implement retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

DATASET : The dataset consists of parameters such as the user's demographic and Pil details, membership account details, duration and frequency of their visits to the website, reported grievances and feedback, and the like.

KEY FEARURES:
Data Analysis: Comprehensive analysis of customer data to identify patterns and trends.
Machine Learning Models: Utilization of advanced ML models, including XGBoost, to predict churn probability.
Model Evaluation: Rigorous evaluation of models to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Predictive Insights: Generation of actionable insights to guide business decisions and retention strategies.

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
XGBoost.(Maximum accuracy)
Decision Tree.
Random Forest

DEPLOYMENT:
The API interfacing for the deplyment on Localhost is done using Flask.The server is run on Local system during the staging of the project.Older deployment was done on Google Cloud Platform

PREDICTIONS:
The final prediction of the model is the range of 1-5 churn for that customer.
The prediction signifies the chances of the customer to leave the services of the bank which makes the bank to focus more on such such customers and try to retain them using Sales and Marketing strategies about which I have worked in this GitHub module.

CONCLUSION: 
The implementation of machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, Decision Trees, and Random Forest has significantly improved our ability to predict and manage customer churn. Among these algorithms, XGBoost stands out for its exceptional accuracy and robustness. Its advanced boosting technique enables precise predictions, empowering proactive retention strategies and driving business success.
